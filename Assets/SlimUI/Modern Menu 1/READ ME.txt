Thank you for downloading the Modern UI Menu Template! We hope that you find 
it easy to use and easy to implement into your game! 

If you want to learn how to make this project from scratch, I have a 
YouTube tutorial series that walks you through every step. This version 
has been converted to C# but the YouTube version was written in JavaScript 
since it was a while ago. The base scripts are all there and you can 
customize them as you wish. This project is free to use and I hope to see 
somecool variations of it in the future!
