PathFinder is a 3rd person shooter & 3D platform game. Write with Unity 3D and C#.

The game is composed by 3 levels. The aim of each level is found a key collectible. This key can open the door which leads to the next level.

The best way to accomplish the levels is to keep stealth. The lights won't help you, shoot them!
